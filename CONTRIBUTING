# Contributing to kcheck #

As someone with a seemingly never-ending demand on limited time resources, I
welcome any and all contributions to this project. Whether it's in the form of
feature suggestions, code improvements, or problem cases, help me make Linux
kernel configuration somewhat less onerous.

## Issues and features ##

_Every program can be reduced by one line of code, and every program has at
least one bug. Therefore, every program can be reduced to one line of code that
doesn't work._

If you come across a bug or use-case that behaves differently than it should,
please file an [issue](https://github.com/wraeth/kcheck/issues) with a
description and, if applicable, the stack trace or debug log attached.
Similarly, feature-requests should be logged as issues to be tagged and tracked
as such.

## Pull requests ##

Pull requests for code improvements, bug fixes and new features are generally
welcome, however please note that atomic, GPG-signed commits are preferred. See
[the git website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work)
for how to configure git to do this and
[Github's instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-gpg-key-to-your-github-account/)
for verifying commits signed with your GPG key.

## Contact ##

If you need to contact me regarding kcheck outside of Github - for example, if
you don't want your name blasted all over the Internet - you can do so via
[mail](mailto:kcheck@wraeth.id.au), or I can be found under the same nick on
the [Freenode IRC network](https://webchat.freenode.net/). Comments,
suggestions, issues and patches welcome.
